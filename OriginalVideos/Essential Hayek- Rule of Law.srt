7
00:00:16,022 --> 00:00:21,030
to present the key ideas of F.A. Hayek in an easily accessible format
 对哈耶克关键思想的通俗介绍

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,040
In this video, we explore one of Hayek's most profound pursuits
 本视频将介绍哈耶克最重要的思想探索之一

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,022
which is understanding the difference between legislation and the law
 立法和法律的不同

10
00:00:30,022 --> 00:00:35,088
Hayek differentiated between rules consciously designed and imposed on society by government officials
 哈耶克区分了两种规则，由政府官员有意设计并施加于社会的、

11
00:00:35,088 --> 00:00:41,074
and rules that emerge undesigned from social interaction among people over time
 和无人设计、在人们的互动中自发涌现的

12
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:46,012
He called rules imposed on society by government officials legislation
 他把政府制定的规则称为立法

13
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:52,028
and he contrast legislation with those rules that emerge, which he called law
 把自发涌现的规则称作法律，并把二者进行了对比

14
00:00:52,028 --> 00:00:57,068
Hayek's concept of law is a lot like what we today refer to as social norms
 哈耶克所说的法律类似于我们今天所说的社会规范

15
00:00:57,068 --> 00:01:01,006
Let's try to simplify this distinction with an example
 让我们举个栗子来说明这种区分

16
00:01:01,006 --> 00:01:03,012
This is Julie
 这是Julie

17
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:05,056
Julie is going to the movies
 她正要去看电影

18
00:01:05,056 --> 00:01:07,034
When Julie enters the theater
 当Julie来到电影院

19
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:10,044
she finds a seat and puts a coat on it
 她找到了个座位并把外套放了上去

20
00:01:10,044 --> 00:01:15,030
This small act sends a signal to others that the seat is now taken
 这个小举动告诉其他人这个位置已经被占了

21
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,066
People recognize from the placing of the coat
 人们会从放在那的外套看出

22
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:23,012
that someone has staked a claim so to speak, on that seat for the duration of the movie
 已经有人宣示了这个座位在电影放映期间的使用权

23
00:01:23,012 --> 00:01:27,038
No one will move Julie's coat or sit in that seat
 没人会拿开Julie的外套或者去坐那个座位

24
00:01:27,038 --> 00:01:32,042
This rule is a social norm or convention that governs our behavior
 这个规则就是一种约束着我们行为的社会规范，或者叫习俗

25
00:01:32,042 --> 00:01:36,066
No government imposed this rule as a law, but so what
 没有政府把这条规则写进法典，但那又怎样？

26
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:39,044
We all recognize and follow this rule
 我们都理解并遵守这条规则

27
00:01:39,044 --> 00:01:43,066
and we would interpret someone who ignores this rule by moving Julie's coat
 并且假如有人无视这条规则，移走Julie的外套

28
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:45,066
and taking the seat
 一屁股坐下来

29
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:49,028
as someone who violates the normal social behavior
 我们会认为他违反了正常的社会规范

30
00:01:49,028 --> 00:01:53,024
In other words, this social norm constrains the way we act
 换句话说，这条社会规范限制了我们的行为可能

31
00:01:53,024 --> 00:01:58,002
and allows us to interact with one another more effectively
 并且让我们能更有效地与他人互动

32
00:01:58,002 --> 00:02:02,090
Another example can be seen when Julie goes to get popcorn
 当Julie去买爆米花时，我们可以看到另一个例子

33
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:06,034
There is a line at the concession stand
 人们正在小卖部排队购物

34
00:02:06,034 --> 00:02:10,020
but rather than push to the front of line by cutting ahead of everyone
 不过Julie并没有直接插队到第一个

35
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,086
Julie stands at the back and waits for turn
 而是排在了队伍最后耐心等待

36
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:18,018
This is a typical social norm that we all naturally follow without thinking
 这是一个我们所有人都无需思考就会自然遵守的社会规范

37
00:02:18,018 --> 00:02:20,068
and we expect others to do the same
 并且我们预期别人也会这么做

38
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:23,088
It doesn't require government for its enforcement
 它也无需政府来保障它的执行

39
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:27,050
Hayek explained how the social norms that emerge over time
 哈耶克解释了此类

40
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:31,034
through people interacting with one another and figuring out what works
 通过人们的互动和试错自发产生的社会规范

41
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:33,096
powerfully govern our behaviors toward others
 是如何有力地约束我们对其他人的行为的

42
00:02:33,096 --> 00:02:40,002
so that society functions productively, collaboratively, and peacefully
 从而让社会和平、有效率、又相互合作

43
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:42,090
