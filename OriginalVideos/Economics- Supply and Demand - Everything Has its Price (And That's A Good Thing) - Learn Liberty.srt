1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,044
Everyday as a consumer, you interact with and perform minor miracles
 作为消费者，你每天都在与一些小小的奇迹打交道

2
00:00:05,044 --> 00:00:08,012
and yet you probably don't recognize them as such
 不过你可能并不这样看

3
00:00:08,012 --> 00:00:12,052
If you think about them at all, you might consider them as nuisances or as obstacles
 当你念及它们时，你可能还会觉得它们是种妨碍

4
00:00:12,052 --> 00:00:14,052
But while they're largely unappreciated
 不过虽然它们不受待见

5
00:00:14,052 --> 00:00:17,098
these small things actually make our modern lives possible
 现代生活却有赖于这些小东西

6
00:00:17,098 --> 00:00:20,080
What am I talking about? Prices
 我在说什么？价格

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,010
the prices we pay everyday for goods and services
 就是我们每天为商品和服务支付的那个“价格”

8
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,038
You might think they're just the unfortunate cost of getting something you want
 你可能会觉得价格就是为了获取某物而不幸不得不支付的成本

9
00:00:27,038 --> 00:00:29,078
but they're much more than that
 但其实远不止如此

10
00:00:29,078 --> 00:00:34,000
When you learn about the vast amount of information contained within every price
 当你明白了价格背后蕴含着海量的信息后

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,068
each one becomes a marvel
 它们就变成了奇迹

12
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:40,076
a wonder that helps coordinate the billions of choices of multitudes of people
 一个能够将大众数以亿级的不同选择组织进

13
00:00:40,076 --> 00:00:43,046
into a productive and dynamic economy
 一个富有生产力的动态经济体的奇迹

14
00:00:43,046 --> 00:00:45,028
Let me explain
 让我接着说明一下

15
00:00:45,028 --> 00:00:47,028
Think about, say, ketchup
 以番茄酱为例

16
00:00:47,028 --> 00:00:51,038
the primary ingredient in that delicious red source is, of course, tomatoes
 它的主要成分当然就是番茄

17
00:00:51,038 --> 00:00:54,026
Now suppose there is a terrible draught in California
 现在假设加州发生了严重的干旱

18
00:00:54,026 --> 00:00:57,034
this year's tomato harvest drops substantially
 导致今年的番茄产量严重下降

19
00:00:57,034 --> 00:00:58,096
The demand is still there
 但人们对番茄酱的需求却没变

20
00:00:58,096 --> 00:01:03,010
people still want ketchup as much as they did before for there hamburgers and fries
 大家在吃汉堡薯条时依然想配那么多的番茄酱

21
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,040
but the supply is shriveled
 但供应萎缩了

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,072
so farmers start to charge higher prices for their tomatoes
 所以农民开始以更高的价格出售番茄

23
00:01:08,072 --> 00:01:11,026
that means ketchup makers have to pay more for tomatoes
 这意味着番茄酱生产商需要花更多的钱购买番茄

24
00:01:11,026 --> 00:01:13,090
so they charge grocery stores more for their product
 所以他们对下游零售商收取更高的价格

25
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:18,078
and so in turn grocery stores charge higher prices for ketchup to consumers
 最终零售商向消费者出售的番茄酱更贵了

26
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,092
The important point here is just how customers responds
 这里的要点在于消费者如何回应

27
00:01:21,092 --> 00:01:24,006
A few of them won't care much about the higher price
 一小部分消费者不会在意涨价

28
00:01:24,006 --> 00:01:27,018
and they'll continue to buy as many bottles of ketchup as before
 他们会购买像往常一样多的番茄酱

29
00:01:27,018 --> 00:01:29,042
but most consumers will care
 不过大部分消费者会在意涨价

30
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:31,038
they will switch to mayonnaise or to mustard
 他们会转向蛋黄酱或者芥末酱

31
00:01:31,038 --> 00:01:34,012
or just go without condiments altogether
 或者干脆就不用佐料了

32
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:37,030
and that's actually a good outcome given the draught
 考虑到干旱带来的减产，这其实是我们乐见的结果

33
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,096
There simply aren't as many tomatoes to go around as before
 因为市面上就没有像以前那么多的番茄在流通

34
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:43,036
People as a group need to eat fewer tomatoes
 所以整个社会需要减少番茄的消费量

35
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:46,068
and this uptake in the price of ketchup leads some people
 而番茄酱价格的上涨正好让那些

36
00:01:46,068 --> 00:01:51,018
those who care the least about the particular condiment to use less of it
 对番茄酱最不在意的人少吃一些番茄酱

37
00:01:51,018 --> 00:01:54,072
and that means total consumption of tomatoes shrinks
 从而减少了对番茄的总需求

38
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,010
From a bird's eye view
 从火星人的角度来看

39
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,038
it might look as though this chain of events is consciously coordinated
 这一连串事件似乎是精心组织的

40
00:01:59,038 --> 00:02:02,082
that the farmer, manufacturer, grocery stores, and customers
 农民、厂商、零售店、消费者

41
00:02:02,082 --> 00:02:06,052
are all working together according to some plan or to some directive
 似乎是在某种计划或指示下共同合作

42
00:02:06,052 --> 00:02:09,088
to adjust to the fact that the draught destroyed a lot of tomatoes
 以应对干旱带来的番茄减产

43
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:11,058
But of course we know there aren't
 但当然我们知道并没有这样的计划和指示

44
00:02:11,058 --> 00:02:15,026
There is no bureau of condiments ordering people to hold the ketchup
 并没有一个调味料管理局命令人们少吃番茄酱

45
00:02:15,026 --> 00:02:18,036
Information about the need to cut back tomato consumption
 人们需要减少番茄酱消费的信息

46
00:02:18,036 --> 00:02:22,004
was communicated organically through prices
 是通过价格有机传导的

47
00:02:22,004 --> 00:02:24,004
Or as the great economist Friedrich Hayek put it
 或者如伟大的经济学家弗雷德里希·哈耶克所表述的

48
00:02:24,004 --> 00:02:30,016
the ketchup price is, quote, a kind of machinery for registering change, unquote
 番茄酱价格是一种“体现变化的机制”

49
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,080
Now multiply this chain of events by trillions
 如果把这一串事件乘以万亿

50
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,036
that's the world of economy
 那就是全球经济

51
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:40,004
There are billions of buyers and suppliers adjusting in real time, every hour of every day
 数以亿计的买家和卖家每时每刻针对着短缺和富余

52
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:42,004
to shortages and surpluses
 不停地做着实时调整

53
00:02:42,004 --> 00:02:44,096
and they're elaborately coordinating their behavior with each other
 他们精巧地协调彼此的行为

54
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,096
and adjust to on the ground developments
 并适应眼前的变化

55
00:02:46,096 --> 00:02:48,096
and they don't even realize
 他们甚至都没有意识到

56
00:02:48,096 --> 00:02:53,032
they're part of this great global chain of cooperation
 他们是这个了不起的全球合作链的一部分

57
00:02:53,032 --> 00:02:57,002
All of this coordination and adjustment is thanks to prices
 这一切协调与调整都要归功于价格

58
00:02:57,002 --> 00:03:01,068
all those different bits of information conveyed in that one little number
 这个小小的数字传递着所有这些不同的信息

59
00:03:01,068 --> 00:03:05,040
Think about that next time you go to grocery store
 下次去杂货店的时候记得想想这事

60
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,018
We understand the power of prices thanks to economists like Friedrich Hayek
 我们对价格的理解要归功于哈耶克这样的经济学家

61
00:03:09,018 --> 00:03:11,032
To learn more about Hayek's essential ideas
 想了解哈耶克的更多重要思想

62
00:03:11,032 --> 00:03:13,010
and how they help explain our world
 以及它们是怎么解释这个世界的
