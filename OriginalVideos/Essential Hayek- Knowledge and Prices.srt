00:00:25,044 --> 00:00:28,022

 可能也是他最重要的洞见

10
00:00:28,022 --> 00:00:31,076
the role of prices in conveying information

11
00:00:32,094 --> 00:00:37,030
All economists understand that people make decision based on the cost they face
 经济学家都明白人们基于面临的成本

12
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,030
and the benefits they expect to receive
 和预期收益做出决策

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,030
In most cases
 多数情况下

14
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:46,040
the key cost of the decision is the price the person faces to purchase a good or service
 决策的主要成本是个体为商品或服务所支付的价格

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,040
This idea is complex, so let's simplify it with an example
 这个观点有点复杂，所以让我们举个栗子

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,040
This is Sara
 这是Sara

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,040
Sara loves coffee
 她爱喝咖啡

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,040
and prefers Columbian coffee
 尤其喜欢哥伦比亚咖啡

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,048
which she buys from her local grocery store
 她在本地的杂货店购买咖啡

20
00:00:59,048 --> 00:01:03,088
The local store usually sells her favorite coffee to her for 10 dollars
 她最爱的咖啡一般卖10美金

21
00:01:03,088 --> 00:01:06,060
Sara doesn't know any of the details or cost
 Sara并不了解关于咖啡生产的成本和细节

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,060
of how the coffee beans are grown
 例如咖啡豆是怎么种植的

23
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,060
the irrigation of the coffee farm
 咖啡田的灌溉方法

24
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,060
how the beans are roasted
 如何烘焙咖啡豆

25
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,088
or how the coffee is transported to her store
 咖啡是怎么运到杂货店的等等

26
00:01:15,088 --> 00:01:20,018
all she knows is her favorite Columbian coffee costs 10 dollars
 她只知道她最爱喝的哥伦比亚咖啡卖10美金

27
00:01:20,018 --> 00:01:25,038
and that it's worth to her given the enjoyment she gets from drinking Columbian coffee
 并且与她喝咖啡所获得的愉悦相比，这10美金花的值得

28
00:01:25,038 --> 00:01:30,042
but what happens if bad weather in Columbia severely damages the coffee farm field
 不过如果哥伦比亚天气变差，咖啡种植地被毁，将会如何？

29
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:34,018
bad weather and crop damage been fewer coffee beans from Columbian
 变差的天气和损毁的咖啡植株意外着更少的哥伦比亚咖啡豆

30
00:01:34,018 --> 00:01:37,086
and that results in the price of Columbia coffee going up
 这将导致哥伦比亚咖啡的价格上涨

31
00:01:37,086 --> 00:01:40,086
so when Sara next goes to her local grocery store
 所以当Sara下次去杂货店时

32
00:01:40,086 --> 00:01:45,086
she finds the price of her favorite Columbian coffee is now 20 dollars
 她发现她最爱的哥伦比亚咖啡现在要卖20美金了

33
00:01:45,086 --> 00:01:52,032
Sara doesn't know why the price went up, nor did she need to know why
 Sara既不知道、也不需要知道为什么咖啡涨价了

34
00:01:52,032 --> 00:01:58,034
The increased price sends her a signal that prompts her to make an informed decision
 上升的价格促使Sara基于新价格重新做出决定

35
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:01,058
She can pay 20 dollars for her favorite Columbian coffee
 她可以为最爱的咖啡付20块

36
00:02:01,058 --> 00:02:04,038
but, the higher price of the Columbian coffee
 不过，哥伦比亚咖啡的价格越高

37
00:02:04,038 --> 00:02:08,088
means that she will have to give up more something else to buy that coffee
 意味着她为了买咖啡将不得不更多地放弃购买其他东西

38
00:02:08,088 --> 00:02:13,080
In fact, Sara is likely voluntarily choose to buy another type of coffee
 事实上，Sara很可能会自愿去购买另一种

39
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,080
one perhaps even at a lower price than a normal Columbian coffee
 比哥伦比亚咖啡便宜的咖啡

40
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,036
say, Indonesian coffee, which costs 9 dollars
 比如只要9美金的印尼咖啡

41
00:02:22,036 --> 00:02:29,008
so even though Sara doesn't have any of the information about why the price of Columbian coffee changed
 所以即使Sara完全不知道为什么哥伦比亚咖啡的价格上涨了

42
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:34,080
she makes the same decision based purely on the change in price she observes in her grocery store
 她仅仅依靠店里标价做出的决定

43
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:42,078
that she would have made had she known that a weather disaster in Columbian destroyed that much of that country's coffee crop
 与假如她知道哥伦比亚咖啡减产做出的决定会是一致的

44
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:47,034
What Hayek explained and clarified is that people make decisions as if
 哈耶克阐明的正是人们做出的决策就好像

45
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:53,054
they have incredible amount of information about why the price of good or service is what it is
 他们掌握价格变动背后的大量信息一样

46
00:02:53,054 --> 00:02:58,098
when in fact, they have little or no information about why the price is what it is
 但其实他们对价格为何如此一无所知

47
00:02:58,098 --> 00:03:03,038
They simply know what the price is and that is sufficient
 仅仅知道价格是多少

48
00:03:03,038 --> 00:03:07,074
to prompt each of us to act as if we know vast quantities of facts
 就已经足以使人们像掌握了

49
00:03:07,074 --> 00:03:12,056
about economics reality that we can't possibly really know
  其实根本无力掌握的大量经济信息那样作出决策
