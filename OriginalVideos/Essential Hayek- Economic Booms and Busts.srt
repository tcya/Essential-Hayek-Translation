This video was part of the Fraser Institute initiative

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:22,028
to present the key ideas of F.A. Hayek in an easily accessible format
 对哈耶克关键思想的通俗介绍

8
00:00:22,028 --> 00:00:27,044
In this video, we explore Hayek's work on economic booms and busts
 本视频将介绍哈耶克对经济繁荣和衰退的研究

9
00:00:27,044 --> 00:00:32,096
work for which he was awarded a Nobel prize in economics in 1974
 哈耶克因此研究获得了1974年诺贝尔经济学奖

10
00:00:32,096 --> 00:00:38,038
One of Hayek's key observations was that when government interfering the economy
 哈耶克的一个关键发现是政府对经济的干预

11
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:43,008
it results in people acting in ways that are not sustainable
 会导致人们以不可持续的方式行动

12
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:47,080
which ultimately leads to booms and then, inevitably, busts
 这将产生经济的短期繁荣和之后不可避免的萧条

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,044
Let's simplify this idea with an example
 让我们举个栗子来简化下这个想法

14
00:00:50,044 --> 00:00:53,044
This is Brian
 这是Brian

15
00:00:53,044 --> 00:00:59,068
Brian is a politician who thinks he has a great idea for creating jobs and widespread prosperity
 他觉得自己有了一个能制造就业并创造广泛繁荣的好想法

16
00:00:59,068 --> 00:01:01,038
With the best intentions
 怀着最大的好意

17
00:01:01,038 --> 00:01:04,032
Brian convinces his government to support companies
 Brian说服政府支持企业

18
00:01:04,032 --> 00:01:08,082
so that they can develop and build factories to sell chocolate-covered pickles
 以让它们建造生产巧克力裹酸黄瓜的工厂

19
00:01:08,082 --> 00:01:11,030
but Brian's plan is flawed
 但是Brian的计划是有缺陷的

20
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,064
he assumes there will be great demand for chocolate-covered pickles
 他以为对巧克力裹酸黄瓜的需求将会很大

21
00:01:15,064 --> 00:01:18,048
but if they're truly with great demand for chocolate-covered pickles
 但假如真有大量的需求

22
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:20,072
the pickle industry will naturally respond
 酸黄瓜制造业自然会做出反应

23
00:01:20,072 --> 00:01:23,086
and build factories of covered pickles with chocolate
 去建设巧克力裹酸黄瓜工厂

24
00:01:23,086 --> 00:01:26,088
All without the government assistance
 这一切都无需政府帮助

25
00:01:26,088 --> 00:01:31,086
so what happens when there is no real demand by customers for chocolate-covered pickles
 所以假如消费者其实并不需要巧克力裹酸黄瓜，那将会怎样？

26
00:01:31,086 --> 00:01:34,000
the resources provided by the government
 那样的话，政府提供的资源

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,054
whether in the form of direct support like subsidies
 如直接的经济补贴

28
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,088
or indirect support like loan guarantees
 或间接的贷款担保

29
00:01:38,088 --> 00:01:43,044
distorts the economy by encouraging people to make bad decisions
 都会诱使人们做出错误的决策从而扭曲经济

30
00:01:43,044 --> 00:01:44,088
In this case
 在这个例子中

31
00:01:44,088 --> 00:01:49,000
to use resources to make chocolate-covered pickles
 错误决策指的就是调用资源去生产无人需要的巧克力裹酸黄瓜

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
As the lack of demand for these pickles becomes apparent
 当人们意识到对巧克力裹酸黄瓜的需求其实并不存在时

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,032
businesses must adjust by retooling
 企业就必须重组

34
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:56,008
or even scuttling factories
 甚至关闭工厂

35
00:01:56,008 --> 00:01:58,008
adjusting their production lines
 调整生产线

36
00:01:58,008 --> 00:02:01,084
changing their distribution networks, et cetera
 改变分销渠道等等

37
00:02:01,084 --> 00:02:04,094
All of these things mean idle resources in the short term
 这些都意味着在经济体自我调整以适应市场的这段时期

38
00:02:04,094 --> 00:02:09,066
as businesses adjust to the reality of the market
 会产生资源的短期闲置

39
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:11,094
The challenge is to ensure that producers
 经济正确运行的难处就在于如何让生产者

40
00:02:11,094 --> 00:02:14,034
have the knowledge and the incentives to
 获得正确的信息和激励

41
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:17,092
produce goods and services that people want
 去生产人们需要的产品和服务

42
00:02:17,092 --> 00:02:20,002
Government interference, such as through subsidies
 政府干预，例如补贴

43
00:02:20,002 --> 00:02:23,086
or specially importantly, by manipulating the money supply
 或者影响更大的货币供应调节

44
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:27,028
obscure that knowledge by distorting prices
 扭曲了价格从而模糊了传递给生产者的信息

45
00:02:27,028 --> 00:02:28,060
This interference
 这种政府干预

46
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,072
by initially causing producers to tool up
 先会导致厂家升级设备

47
00:02:30,072 --> 00:02:33,028
to produce things that consumers don't really want
 去生产消费者其实并不需要的产品

48
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:37,016
inevitably results in producers having to tool down and readjust
 然后不可避免地废弃设备、重新调整

49
00:02:37,016 --> 00:02:41,024
in order to better meet true consumer demands
 以适应消费者的真实需求

50
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,052
The core insight from Hayek on economic booms and busts
 哈耶克对于经济周期的核心观点在于

51
00:02:44,052 --> 00:02:48,076
is that government interference, even when done with the best intentions
 即使是抱有最大好意的政府干预

52
00:02:48,076 --> 00:02:54,099
changes people's behavior by changing incentives and changing signals in the market
 也会因为改变了市场上的激励和信号而改变人们的行为

53
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:58,028
These changes result in investments that are not sustainable
 这些改变会导致不可持续的投资

54
00:02:58,028 --> 00:03:03,022
and which automatically leads to recessions, or busts
 进而导致经济衰退

55
00:03:03,022 --> 00:03:06,036
