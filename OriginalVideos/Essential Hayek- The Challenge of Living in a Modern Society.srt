those that occur among our family and friends

and those that occur in the external world

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,000
Let's simplify this rather complex idea with an example

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,070

are very different from those in Tom's bike shop

For example, if Tom's son needs his bike repaired

22
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:05,098
he simply asks Tom

00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:11,012
We don't expect Tom to charge his son for the repair as he would a customer in store

24
00:01:11,012 --> 00:01:13,080
Hayek observed that a family is not a market

Tom gains satisfaction from helping his son by repairing his bike

This satisfaction is different from the feelings he experiences with his customers

29
00:01:27,072 --> 00:01:31,026
Almost all of them Tom doesn't know outside the work

30
00:01:31,026 --> 00:01:37,096
Likewise, Hayek explained that society at large cannot operate like a family

00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:40,024
If Tom treated his customers like his son

his business would soon go broke

00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,078
Hayek's point is that markets and economies would collapse

00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:55,094
if we try to operate society at large as if it were one big extended family
 市场和经济将会崩溃

36
00:01:55,094 --> 00:02:00,008
Hayek identified a subtle, but key aspect of a society
 哈耶克指出了一个社会微妙又关键的一面

37
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:04,054
which is that we're governed by two distinct sets of rules and constraints
 即有两套不同的规则和约束作用于我们的行为

38
00:02:04,054 --> 00:02:07,028
both function well within their own spheres
 在它们各自的范围内都运行良好

39
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:14,054
but great disruptions and costs occur when we try to transplant one set of rules to the other sphere
 但当我们把其中之一用于另一个的范围时，就会导致严重的破坏
